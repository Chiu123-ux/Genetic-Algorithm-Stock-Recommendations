本质是遗传算法应用时序函数，后续改进方向是加入时间切片函数
用原始因子合成遗传算法选择的因子，然后进行回测，月度周度换手均可

原始量价数据可由tushare获得，太大了我就不上传了

主程序在新回测，pkl原始文件需要自己导入并且匹配格式

The essence is the application of a genetic algorithm to time-series functions. Future improvements involve incorporating time-slicing functions.  
The original factors are synthesized using the genetic algorithm-selected factors, followed by backtesting. Monthly or weekly turnover rates can both be applied.  

The original price-volume data can be obtained from Tushare. The file is too large, so I will not upload it.  

The main program is in the new backtesting file. The original PKL files need to be imported independently, and the format must be matched.
